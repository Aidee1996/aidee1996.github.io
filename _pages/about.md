I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate of Czech Philology at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University üéì. I also work at the Department of Language Development at the [Czech Language Institue of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://ujc.cas.cz/cs/pracovnici/michalcova-anna-mgr-profil/). My research focuses on diachronic linguistics, Old Czech, and the development of Old Czech biblical translation. In my dissertation, I examine the orthography and phonology of the so-called Cistercian Bible from 1456, conducted under the expert guidance of [Kate≈ôina Volekov√°](https://ujc.cas.cz/cs/pracovnici/volekova-katerina-mgr-ph-d-profil/).

Additionally, I am interested in the application of modern technologies such as HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) üñãÔ∏è in linguistic research. In this area, I am deeply involved in the use of software solutions like [Pero OCR](https://pero-ocr.fit.vutbr.cz) and [Transkribus](https://www.transkribus.org/), developing [models](https://readcoop.eu/model/old-czech-handwriting-with-spaces/) for automatic text recognition in Old Czech manuscripts. I also contribute to the [Electronic Dictionary of Old Czech](https://ujc.cas.cz/cs/elektronicke-slovniky-a-zdroje/elektronicky-slovnik-stare-cestiny/) üìñ.

I prefer to be called Anna, as that's my name, and I'm not really a fan of diminutives (including Aniƒçka). That said, I'm quite used to it, so whatever floats your boat! üö§
